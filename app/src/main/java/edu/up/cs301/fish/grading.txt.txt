a.) Functionality that deserves extra points:
	When your penguin is selected it highlights. If you tap it again it deselects.
	A help dialog box appears at start of game and if you need it again you can get it in the action bar menu

b.) Notes on playing the game
	If you try to make an invalid move, such as tapping a tile that is not in an adjacent path from your selected tile, it will not flash red.
